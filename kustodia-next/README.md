This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## June 2025: Major UI & Integration Improvements

### 1. Backend API Integration (No More 404s!)
- All `/api/*` requests from the Next.js frontend are now automatically proxied to the backend server (port 4000) during development.
- This is handled via a rewrite rule in `next.config.js`, so you do not need to change any fetch URLs in your code.
- **How it works:**
  - In development, requests like `/api/users/verify-recipient` go straight to the backend, not the Next.js server.
  - No more 404 errors for backend API calls!

### 2. Maximum Readability: Pure Black Text
- All primary and secondary text in tables, cards, headers, and forms now uses pure black (`#000`) for the highest possible contrast.
- All Tailwind classes like `text-gray-800`, `text-gray-900`, etc., have been replaced with `text-black` in major UI components.
- The CSS variable `--foreground` is also set to pure black in `globals.css`.

### 3. Font and Sizing Best Practices
- The app uses a consistent, readable font stack. (Consider switching to Inter or another modern sans-serif for an even more polished look.)
- Font sizes and weights are applied consistently using Tailwind classes:
  - Dashboard/page titles: `text-2xl`/`text-3xl` + `font-bold`
  - Section headings: `text-xl` + `font-semibold`
  - Table headers: `text-base`/`text-sm` + `font-bold`
  - Body text: `text-base`
  - Captions/hints: `text-sm` or `text-xs`
- Line heights and spacing use Tailwind defaults for clear vertical rhythm.

### 4. How to Maintain or Extend
- Use `text-black` for all new text elements/components.
- For new backend endpoints, no need to change fetch URLsâ€”just use `/api/your-endpoint` and the proxy will handle it.
- For further typography improvements, consider adding the Inter font via Google Fonts and updating your Tailwind config.
- Always use Tailwind classes for font size/weight instead of inline styles.
