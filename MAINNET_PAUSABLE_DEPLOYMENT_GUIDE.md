## üîß Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Required for deployment
MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_mainnet_private_key_here
ARBITRUM_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc

# Optional for contract verification
ARBISCAN_API_KEY=your_arbiscan_api_key_here

# MXNB token integration
MXNB_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xf197ffc28c23e0309b5559e7a166f2c6164c80aa
```

### 2. Wallet Configuration
- **Mainnet Wallet**: `0xC8d5563BF6df6C5E5F6DFc42BeEC1CC8598aC38F`
- **Target Network**: Arbitrum Mainnet (Chain ID: 42161)
- **Minimum Balance**: 0.05 ETH (recommended: 0.1 ETH)

### 3. Role Assignments
Both contracts will be deployed with the following roles:
- **Admin Role**: `0xC8d5563BF6df6C5E5F6DFc42BeEC1CC8598aC38F`
- **Pauser Role**: `0xC8d5563BF6df6C5E5F6DFc42BeEC1CC8598aC38F`
- **Bridge Wallet** (Escrow): `0xC8d5563BF6df6C5E5F6DFc42BeEC1CC8598aC38F`
- **Platform Wallet** (Escrow): `0xC8d5563BF6df6C5E5F6DFc42BeEC1CC8598aC38F`

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/preDeploymentChecklist.js --network arbitrum-mainnet
```

This will check:
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity and chain ID
- ‚úÖ Wallet balance and address validation
- ‚úÖ Contract compilation (pausable versions)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables
- ‚úÖ Gas estimation with proxy overhead

### Step 2: Compile Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Ensure both pausable contracts compile successfully:
- `KustodiaEscrow2_0Pausable.sol`
- `UniversalAssetNFTPausable.sol`

### Step 3: Deploy to Mainnet
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deployMainnetPausable.js --network arbitrum-mainnet
```

The deployment script will:
1. Deploy implementation contracts
2. Deploy UUPS proxy contracts
3. Initialize contracts with proper roles
4. Verify contracts on Arbiscan
5. Generate deployment summary
6. Create `.env.mainnet.pausable` template

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

#### Verify Contract Deployment
Check that contracts are deployed and verified on Arbiscan:
- Implementation contracts should be verified automatically
- Proxy contracts should show proper initialization

#### Verify Role Assignments
The deployment script will automatically verify:
- Admin roles are assigned correctly
- Pauser roles are assigned correctly
- Bridge wallet has proper permissions
- Contracts are not paused initially

#### Test Pause Functionality
After deployment, test the pause functionality:
```bash
# This will be included in the deployment script
# Contracts should be deployed in unpaused state
# Admin should be able to pause/unpause
```

## üìä Estimated Costs

### Gas Estimates
- **Escrow Implementation**: ~3,500,000 gas
- **NFT Implementation**: ~3,000,000 gas
- **Proxy Deployments**: ~1,000,000 gas (2 proxies)
- **Initialization**: ~500,000 gas
- **Total**: ~8,000,000 gas

### ETH Cost (at 0.5 gwei)
- **Total Cost**: ~0.004 ETH
- **With Safety Margin**: ~0.01 ETH
- **Recommended Balance**: 0.1 ETH

## üîí Security Features

### Pausable Functionality
- **Emergency Pause**: Authorized pausers can pause contracts in emergencies
- **Role-Based Control**: Only `PAUSER_ROLE` holders can pause/unpause
- **State Protection**: All state-changing functions respect pause state
- **Granular Control**: Each contract can be paused independently

### Upgradeable Architecture
- **UUPS Pattern**: Upgrade logic is in implementation contract
- **Admin Control**: Only admin can authorize upgrades
- **Initialization**: Proper initialization prevents implementation hijacking
- **Storage Safety**: Upgrades maintain storage layout compatibility

### Access Control
- **Role Hierarchy**: Admin can grant/revoke pauser roles
- **Bridge Restrictions**: Escrow functions restricted to bridge wallet
- **Multi-Role Support**: Contracts support multiple role holders

## üìù Post-Deployment Actions

### 1. Update Backend Configuration
Update your backend environment with new contract addresses:
```bash
# Add to your backend .env
ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # From deployment output
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...    # From deployment output
```

### 2. Update Frontend Configuration
Update frontend contract addresses and ABIs:
- Copy new contract addresses from deployment output
- Update ABI files with pausable contract ABIs
- Test pause state detection in UI

### 3. Integration Testing
- Test normal escrow creation and release
- Test NFT minting and transfers
- Test pause/unpause functionality
- Verify role-based access control
- Test upgrade functionality (on testnet first)

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- Monitor contract pause states
- Set up alerts for pause events
- Monitor role changes
- Track upgrade events

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Pausing Contracts
If emergency pause is needed:
```bash
# Using ethers.js or web3
await escrowContract.pause(); // Must be called by PAUSER_ROLE
await nftContract.pause();    // Must be called by PAUSER_ROLE
```

### Unpausing Contracts
When safe to resume:
```bash
await escrowContract.unpause(); // Must be called by PAUSER_ROLE
await nftContract.unpause();    // Must be called by PAUSER_ROLE
```

### Role Management
- **Add Pauser**: `grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, newPauserAddress)`
- **Remove Pauser**: `revokeRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauserAddress)`
- **Transfer Admin**: `grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, newAdminAddress)`
