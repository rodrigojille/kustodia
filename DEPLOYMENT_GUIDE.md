# NFT Asset Platform Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Development)

Your backend should now start without errors. The NFT functionality will be disabled until contracts are deployed, but all other features work normally.

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **Backend configured** - Server starts with placeholder values  
✅ **API endpoints ready** - All NFT routes available  
✅ **Frontend components** - UI ready for NFT creation  
⏳ **Smart contracts** - Need deployment to blockchain  
⏳ **Private key** - Need deployer wallet setup  

## 🔧 Environment Variables Added

```bash
# Blockchain Configuration for NFT Service
RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
KUSTODIA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
UNIVERSAL_ASSET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
VEHICLE_ASSET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
PROPERTY_ASSET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 Next Steps for Full Deployment

### 1. **Generate Deployer Wallet**
```bash
# Install ethers CLI (if needed)
npm install -g ethers

# Generate new wallet
node -e "
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();
console.log('Address:', wallet.address);
console.log('Private Key:', wallet.privateKey);
console.log('Mnemonic:', wallet.mnemonic.phrase);
"
```

### 2. **Fund Deployer Wallet**
- Send ETH to the generated address on Arbitrum Sepolia testnet
- Get testnet ETH from: https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia

### 3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
```bash
# Install Hardhat (deployment framework)
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers

# Create deployment script
# (We can create this for you)
```

### 4. **Update Environment Variables**
Replace the placeholder values with real addresses after deployment:
```bash
KUSTODIA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x[your_real_private_key]
UNIVERSAL_ASSET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x[deployed_contract_address]
VEHICLE_ASSET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x[deployed_contract_address]
PROPERTY_ASSET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x[deployed_contract_address]
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Never commit private keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
- **Consider multi-signature wallets** for production
- **Audit smart contracts** before mainnet deployment

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Mainnet Configuration
```bash
# For production, use Arbitrum mainnet
RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
# Use production frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=https://kustodia.mx
```

### Multi-Signature Setup
For production, consider using a multi-sig wallet like Gnosis Safe:
1. Create multi-sig wallet
2. Add team members as signers
3. Use multi-sig address as contract owner
4. Require multiple signatures for critical operations

## 📊 Revenue Configuration

The platform is designed with built-in revenue streams:

1. **NFT Creation Fees** - Charge users for minting
2. **Service Update Fees** - Dealerships pay for record updates
3. **Verification Fees** - Premium verification services
4. **API Licensing** - Third-party marketplace integrations

## 🧪 Testing

### Test NFT Creation (After Deployment)
```bash
# Test vehicle NFT creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/assets/create-for-marketplace \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [your_jwt_token]" \
  -d '{
    "assetType": "vehicle",
    "assetData": {
      "vin": "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
      "make": "Honda",
      "model": "Civic",
      "year": 2021
    },
    "intendedMarketplace": "OpenSea"
  }'
```

## 🎉 Ready to Launch

Once contracts are deployed and environment variables updated:

1. **Sellers** can create NFTs before listing
2. **Buyers** purchase through Kustodia payment flow
3. **NFTs transfer automatically** on payment completion
4. **Service providers** can update asset records
5. **Users** see their NFTs in wallet dashboard

The platform will be ready for your $100B+ addressable market! 🚀
