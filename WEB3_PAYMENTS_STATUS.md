# Web3 Payments - Current Status and Decisions

## üìã **Current Status: TEMPORARILY DISABLED**

**Date:** January 29, 2025  
**Decision:** Web3 payment functionality has been temporarily disabled due to ongoing Portal API authentication issues.

---

## üöß **Issues Encountered**

### Portal API Authentication Problems
- **401 Unauthorized errors** when calling Portal v3 API build-transaction endpoint
- **500 AUTH_FAILED (code 202)** errors from Portal MPC Enclave API during transaction signing
- **Root Cause:** Suspected API key permission issues or Portal v3 API limitations with complex escrow contract interactions

### Technical Details
- Portal Client API Key: Configured and verified
- Portal Custodian API Key: Configured and verified  
- User portal_client_id: Fixed database inconsistency issues
- Transaction signing flow: Attempted both Portal v3 API and direct MPC Enclave approaches

---

## üîß **Changes Made**

### Backend Changes
- **File:** `backend/src/routes/web3Payment.ts`
- **Changes:** 
  - Added comprehensive debugging logs for API key verification
  - Simplified transaction signing to use only MPC Enclave API directly
  - Enhanced error handling for AUTH_FAILED scenarios
  - Bypassed Portal v3 build-transaction API due to persistent 401 errors

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Payment Creation UI (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/crear-pago/page.tsx`)
- **REMOVED:** Web3 payment card from payment type selection
- **REPLACED WITH:** Existing cobros flow (commission-based payments)
- **Reason:** Avoid user confusion while Web3 payments are disabled

#### 2. Dashboard Wallet Section (`frontend/src/components/RevolutAccountCards.tsx`)
- **REMOVED:** Entire wallet card section including:
  - MXNB balance display
  - Deposit CLABE functionality  
  - Wallet address display
  - Wallet activation buttons
- **Reason:** Prevent users from attempting to use disabled Web3 features

---

## üéØ **Current User Experience**

### Payment Creation Flow
Users now see 3 payment options:
1. **Pago Simple** - Standard conditional payments
2. **Pago Condicional Premium** - Advanced conditional payments with dual approval
3. **Cobro Condicional Premium** - Commission-based payment requests (replaces Web3)

### Dashboard Experience
- Wallet-related functionality completely hidden
- Users cannot access Web3 payment features
- Focus on traditional payment flows that are fully operational

---

## üîç **Technical Investigation Needed**

### Portal API Issues
1. **API Key Permissions:** Verify Portal dashboard settings for API key scopes
2. **Portal v3 Limitations:** Confirm if Portal v3 API supports complex smart contract interactions
3. **Authentication Flow:** Review Portal documentation for proper MPC Enclave API usage

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Direct Web3 Signing:** Implement ethers.js-based transaction signing as fallback
2. **Portal API Versions:** Test different Portal API endpoints and versions
3. **Transaction Structure:** Simplify escrow contract interactions for Portal compatibility

## üìã **Resumption Checklist**

When ready to re-enable Web3 payments:

### ‚úÖ **Prerequisites**
- [ ] Resolve Portal API authentication issues
- [ ] Verify API key permissions in Portal dashboard
- [ ] Test end-to-end transaction signing flow
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### ‚úÖ **Code Changes Required**
- [ ] Re-enable Web3 payment card in `crear-pago/page.tsx`
- [ ] Restore wallet section in `RevolutAccountCards.tsx`
- [ ] Update payment card availability: `available: true`
- [ ] Test Web3 payment form functionality

### ‚úÖ **Testing Requirements**
- [ ] Portal API authentication working
- [ ] Transaction building successful
- [ ] Transaction signing successful
- [ ] Escrow contract interaction working
- [ ] End-to-end payment flow complete

---

## üîê **Security Considerations**

### API Keys
- Portal Client API Key: Stored in environment variables
- Portal Custodian API Key: Stored in environment variables
- Private Keys: Not currently used (Portal handles signing)

### Future Security Audit
- Review API key storage and rotation policies
- Audit transaction signing security
- Verify escrow contract security
- Test for potential attack vectors

## üìû **Contact & Support**

For questions about Web3 payment resumption:
- Review Portal HQ documentation
- Check Portal API key permissions in dashboard
- Test Portal MPC Enclave API directly
- Consider direct Web3 implementation as backup
