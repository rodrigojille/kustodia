# Progress Summary: July 9, 2025

This document summarizes the key fixes, enhancements, and investigations completed today.

## Core Objectives Achieved:

1.  **Favicon Fixed:** The broken favicon issue was resolved by correcting the file path in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`. The brand icon now displays correctly in browser tabs.

2.  **Dashboard Counts Corrected:** The critical bug showing "0" for active escrows and payments in custody on both the main and admin dashboards was fully resolved.
    *   **Root Cause:** A `ConnectionNotFoundError` in the backend's `getAllPaymentsController` prevented the `/api/payments` endpoint from connecting to the database, causing it to return an empty array.
    *   **Fix:** The database connection logic was corrected, allowing the endpoint to fetch and return payment data successfully.

3.  **Admin Dashboard Overhaul:** The "Centro de Operaciones" in the Admin Panel has been significantly improved for better operational visibility.
    *   **Initial Bug Fix:** A typo in a `useEffect` hook (`fetchSystemOverview` instead of `fetchSystemData`) was corrected, which fixed the initial data loading failure for the "Escrows Activos" card.
    *   **UI Enhancement:** The static "Pagos Hoy" and "Escrows Activos" cards were replaced with dynamic, data-driven cards for **"Pagos Pendientes"** and **"Pagos en Custodia"**. These new cards show both the count and total monetary amount, providing a much clearer overview of the platform's financial state.

## Outcome

All primary objectives for the session were met. The user-facing and admin dashboards are now displaying accurate, real-time data. The application's UI is more reliable and functional, providing a solid foundation for the next phase of development focused on security and production readiness.
