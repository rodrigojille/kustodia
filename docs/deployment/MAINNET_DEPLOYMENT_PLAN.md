## üåê **MAINNET DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
- [ ] **Production Heroku App**
  - [ ] Create new Heroku app for mainnet
  - [ ] Configure production domain
  - [ ] Set up SSL certificates
  - [ ] Configure CDN if needed

- [ ] **Database Migration**
  - [ ] Set up production PostgreSQL
  - [ ] Run schema migrations
  - [ ] Configure database backups
  - [ ] Set up monitoring

### **Phase 2: Environment Configuration**
- [ ] **Blockchain Networks**
  - [ ] Switch from Sepolia to Ethereum Mainnet
  - [ ] Update RPC endpoints to mainnet
  - [ ] Deploy smart contracts to mainnet
  - [ ] Verify contract addresses

- [ ] **External Services**
  - [ ] **Juno API**: Switch to production endpoints
  - [ ] **Email Service**: Configure production SMTP
  - [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up production alerts

### **Phase 3: Security Hardening**
- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  - [ ] Generate new production secrets
  - [ ] Update JWT signing keys
  - [ ] Configure SPEI signature keys
  - [ ] Set production API keys

- [ ] **Access Control**
  - [ ] Review admin permissions
  - [ ] Configure production OAuth
  - [ ] Set up rate limiting
  - [ ] Enable security headers

### **Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability**
- [ ] **Application Monitoring**
  - [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)
  - [ ] Configure performance monitoring
  - [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
  - [ ] Create alerting rules

- [ ] **Business Metrics**
  - [ ] Payment success rates
  - [ ] SPEI receipt generation metrics
  - [ ] User activity tracking
  - [ ] Financial reconciliation

## üîß **TECHNICAL MIGRATION STEPS**

### **1. Smart Contract Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to Ethereum Mainnet
cd contracts
npm run deploy:mainnet

# Verify contracts on Etherscan
npm run verify:mainnet
```

### **2. Environment Variables Update**
```bash
# Critical mainnet environment variables
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # New mainnet address
BRIDGE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=... # New production wallet
JUNO_API_BASE_URL=https://api.juno.finance # Production API
```

### **3. Database Migration**
```bash
# Run production schema sync
npm run force-schema-sync:production

# Verify all tables created
npm run health-check:production
```

### **4. Deployment Commands**
```bash
# Deploy to production Heroku app
git push production main

# Run post-deployment verification
npm run test:production
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] All payment flows working end-to-end
- [ ] SPEI receipts generating correctly
- [ ] Email notifications delivering
- [ ] Automation services running
- [ ] Admin panel accessible

### **Performance Requirements**
- [ ] API response times < 2s
- [ ] PDF generation < 5s
- [ ] 99.9% uptime target
- [ ] Zero data loss

### **Security Requirements**
- [ ] All secrets properly secured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Audit logs enabled

---

## üö® **ROLLBACK PLAN**

### **If Issues Arise:**
1. **Immediate**: Switch DNS back to testnet
2. **Database**: Restore from backup
3. **Contracts**: Use previous verified addresses
4. **Communication**: Notify users of maintenance

### **Rollback Commands**
```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
heroku rollback --app kustodia-production

# Database restore (if needed)
heroku pg:backups:restore --app kustodia-production
```

---

## üìÖ **DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE**

### **Recommended Schedule:**
- **Day 1**: Final testnet validation (2 test payments)
- **Day 2**: Infrastructure setup and contract deployment
- **Day 3**: Environment configuration and security review
- **Day 4**: Production deployment and monitoring setup
- **Day 5**: Go-live and user communication

### **Maintenance Window:**
- **Duration**: 2-4 hours
- **Timing**: Off-peak hours (early morning)
- **Communication**: 48-hour advance notice to users

---

## üìû **SUPPORT & MONITORING**

### **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
- [ ] Monitor error rates first 24 hours
- [ ] Validate first production payments
- [ ] Check all automation services
- [ ] Verify receipt generation and delivery

### **Emergency Contacts**
- **Technical Lead**: Available during deployment window
- **DevOps**: On-call for infrastructure issues
- **Business**: Available for user communication

---

## ‚úÖ **FINAL VALIDATION**

Before going live, ensure:
- [ ] All test payments completed successfully
- [ ] Documentation updated with mainnet details
- [ ] Team trained on production procedures
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
