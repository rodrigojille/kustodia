## üîß Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Development (Weeks 1-2)

#### Multi-Sig Contract Architecture
```solidity
// Core multi-sig functionality
contract KustodiaMultiSig {
    struct Transaction {
        address to;
        uint256 value;
        bytes data;
        bool executed;
        uint256 confirmations;
        mapping(address => bool) isConfirmed;
    }
    
    address[] public owners;
    uint256 public required;
    mapping(address => bool) public isOwner;
    Transaction[] public transactions;
}
```

#### Key Features
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Adjustable signature requirements
- **Owner Management**: Add/remove signers with consensus
- **Transaction Queuing**: Batch operations for efficiency
- **Time Locks**: Delayed execution for sensitive operations
- **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker functionality

### Phase 2: Backend Integration (Weeks 2-3)

#### Multi-Sig Service Implementation
```typescript
// Multi-sig service for backend integration
class MultiSigService {
  async createTransaction(to: string, value: string, data: string): Promise<string>
  async confirmTransaction(txId: string, signature: string): Promise<boolean>
  async executeTransaction(txId: string): Promise<string>
  async getTransactionStatus(txId: string): Promise<TransactionStatus>
}
```

#### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Multi-sig transactions table
CREATE TABLE multisig_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  wallet_address VARCHAR(42) NOT NULL,
  transaction_hash VARCHAR(66),
  to_address VARCHAR(42) NOT NULL,
  value DECIMAL(36,18) NOT NULL,
  data TEXT,
  confirmations_required INTEGER NOT NULL,
  confirmations_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  executed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Multi-sig confirmations table
CREATE TABLE multisig_confirmations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES multisig_transactions(id),
  signer_address VARCHAR(42) NOT NULL,
  signature VARCHAR(132) NOT NULL,
  confirmed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Weeks 3-4)

#### Multi-Sig Dashboard Components
- **Transaction Queue**: Pending transactions requiring signatures
- **Signature Interface**: Web3 wallet integration for signing
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time transaction status updates
- **History View**: Complete audit trail of multi-sig operations

#### User Experience Flow
1. **Transaction Initiation**: Authorized user creates transaction
2. **Notification System**: Alert other signers via email/SMS
3. **Signature Collection**: Signers approve via Web3 wallets
4. **Automatic Execution**: Transaction executes when threshold met
5. **Confirmation**: All parties notified of completion

## üîí Security Considerations

### Key Management
- **Hardware Wallets**: Ledger/Trezor for high-value signers
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of signing keys
- **Backup Strategy**: Secure key recovery procedures
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different operations

### Operational Security
- **Approval Workflows**: Defined processes for different transaction types
- **Time Delays**: Mandatory waiting periods for large transactions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for suspicious activities
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable records of all operations

### Smart Contract Security
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of contract correctness
- **Multiple Audits**: Independent security reviews
- **Bug Bounty**: Incentivized vulnerability discovery
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment with increasing limits
