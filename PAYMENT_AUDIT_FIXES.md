# Payment Audit & Database Integrity Report

## 1. Summary

During a routine audit of the wallet backup and recovery system, a critical database schema issue was identified. The database contains two tables with nearly identical names: `dispute_message` (singular) and `dispute_messages` (plural). This created significant confusion and posed a risk to data integrity, as developers could have inadvertently written to or deleted the wrong table.

This document outlines the investigation, conclusion, and recommended action to resolve this issue.

## 2. Investigation & Findings

To determine which table was in active use, the backend codebase was analyzed, focusing on the TypeORM entities and controllers responsible for handling dispute messages.

- **Entity Analysis (`src/entity/DisputeMessage.ts`):** The `DisputeMessage` entity, which is the primary object used by the application to interact with dispute message data, is explicitly mapped to the **`dispute_messages`** (plural) table using the `@Entity('dispute_messages')` decorator.

- **Controller Analysis (`src/controllers/disputeMessageController.ts`):** The `disputeMessageController` exclusively uses the `DisputeMessage` repository (`getRepository(DisputeMessage)`). All database operations for creating and retrieving dispute messages are therefore directed to the `dispute_messages` (plural) table.

**Conclusion:** The application code is definitively and exclusively using the `dispute_messages` (plural) table. The `dispute_message` (singular) table is an orphaned or legacy artifact and is not in active use by the current application.

## 3. Recommended Action

To prevent future confusion and potential data loss, the obsolete `dispute_message` table should be removed from the database.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Backup:** Before proceeding, perform a full backup of the production database to ensure no data is lost in case of unforeseen issues.
2.  **Verification:** Manually run a `SELECT` query on the `dispute_message` (singular) table to confirm it contains no critical data or that any data it contains is redundant and already present in `dispute_messages`.
3.  **Deletion:** Execute the following SQL command to safely remove the obsolete table:
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE dispute_message;
    ```
4.  **Monitoring:** After deletion, monitor the application logs for any errors related to database operations to ensure there were no hidden dependencies on the deleted table.

By following this plan, we can safely clean up the database schema, improve data integrity, and reduce the risk of future development errors.
